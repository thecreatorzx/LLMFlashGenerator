Below is a comprehensive and professional README markdown file for your Flashcard Generation Tool project. It’s designed to be clear, concise, and appealing to evaluators, while showcasing the project’s features, setup instructions, usage details, and potential for extensibility.

Flashcard Generator
A lightweight, web-based Flashcard Generation Tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to transform educational content into concise question-answer flashcards. Built with Flask for a simple and intuitive user interface, this tool supports text and PDF inputs, topic grouping, difficulty levels, and multiple export formats, including Anki compatibility.

Features
Input Flexibility: Accepts raw educational content via text input or file upload (.txt, .pdf).
Smart Flashcard Generation: Produces 10-15 flashcards per submission with clear questions, accurate answers, topic grouping, and difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
Export Options: Download flashcards as CSV, JSON, or Anki-compatible text files.
User-Friendly UI: Built with Flask, featuring a responsive design for input submission and flashcard review.
Edit Functionality: Client-side demo for editing flashcards (non-persistent for prototype).
Extensibility: Modular code structure for easy integration of new features or alternative LLMs.

Future Improvements
Persistent Edits: Implement server-side storage for edited flashcards.
Multi-Language Support: Add translation capabilities for flashcards.
Alternative LLMs: Integrate open-source models (e.g., Hugging Face's Mistral or Phi).
Deployment: Host the app on platforms like Render or Heroku for public access.
Advanced UI: Enhance with JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React) for a richer experience.
Evaluation Highlights

Flashcard Generator README in Markdown Format

Flashcard Generator
The Flashcard Generator project utilizes a BART-based NLP model to automatically generate flashcards (question-answer pairs) from a given text. It provides a RESTful API endpoint to create flashcards based on user input. The project leverages natural language processing and deep learning techniques (NLTK, Transformers, Sentence-BERT) to extract relevant information and produce high-quality flashcards for efficient learning.
Features
Tokenize the input text into sentences using the nltk library.
Generate questions from each sentence using the text2text-generation pipeline (T5-based language models).
Rank the generated questions based on their relevance using Sentence-BERT (sentence embeddings).
Select the most significant questions based on the ranking.
Find accurate answers to the selected questions within the input text using a BART-based model.
Create a set of flashcards, each containing a generated question and its corresponding answer.
Requirements
Python 3.x
nltk – Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and tokenization.
transformers – Hugging Face Transformers library (to load BART and tokenizer).
torch – PyTorch (deep learning framework).
sentence-transformers – Sentence Transformer library (for encoding questions and computing similarity scores).
flask – Flask web framework (for API endpoint).
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flashcard-Generator.git
Install dependencies:
pip install flask transformers sentence-transformers nltk
Download NLTK data (if needed):
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
The NLTK punkt tokenizer data is required for sentence tokenization.
Usage
Run the API:
python app.py
This starts the Flask server on http://localhost:5000.
Send a POST request to the /generate_flashcards endpoint with a JSON payload. For example, using curl or a tool like Postman:
Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/generate_flashcards
Request Body (JSON):
{
"num_flashcards_limit": 5,
"text": "Enter your text here."
}
Replace "Enter your text here." with the text you want to generate flashcards from, and set num_flashcards_limit to the desired number of flashcards.
Parameters:
text (string): The input text from which flashcards will be generated.
num_flashcards_limit (integer): The number of flashcards to create.
Example Response: The API returns a JSON object containing the generated flashcards. Example output:
{
"flashcards": [
{
"question": "Question 1",
"answer": "Answer 1"
},
{
"question": "Question 2",
"answer": "Answer 2"
}
]
}
Example Flashcard:
Question: What is the capital of France?
Answer: Paris
